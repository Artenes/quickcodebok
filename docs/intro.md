# Quick Code BOK

This website is a quick reference for any tool that I use as a software developer.

There are references for the following tools:

- Android
- Node

For each tool there might at least one of the following sections:

- ui - contents related to user interface
- model - contents related to data processing, libraries and such
- test - contents related to how to test the tool
